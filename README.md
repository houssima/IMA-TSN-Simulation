# IMA-TSN-Simulation
This code is a simulator for IMA-TSN systems.
Run "scenarioBuilder.py" for an example of simulation.
The configuration files are stored in confs, they describe firstly the structure of the platform and secondly the scheduling policies applied to the resources of the system.
###
This work is based on the article "A Unified Model for Integrated Modular Architecture-TSN based Systems" in ETFA 2023 proceedings.
